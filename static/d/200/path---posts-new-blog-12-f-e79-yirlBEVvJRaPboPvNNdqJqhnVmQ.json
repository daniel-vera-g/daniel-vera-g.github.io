The main reasons for this were more ease of use, maintainability and scalability.<br>\nAfter researching a bit I went with <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">GatsbyJS</a> over other great alternatives like Hugo or Jeykill.  </p>\n<p>The reasons for this were clear:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Gatsby is written in Javascript, that means no new language like Go(Hugo) or Ruby(Jeykill)</li>\n<li>Gatsby uses React and GraphQL, which are very interesting technologies I want to learn more about.</li>\n<li>You can use Markdown to write blog posts and customize the website, which is great.</li>\n<li>The community is very helpful and there are a lot of great themes as well as plugins to use.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I went with the <a href=\"https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen\">Gatsby starter Lumen</a> theme, because of its simplicity and active development.</p>\n<h2 id=\"workflow\"><a href=\"#workflow\" aria-label=\"workflow permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Workflow</h2>\n<p>After some changes, now my workflow is pretty simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Write a blog post</li>\n<li>Push it to GitHub</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The only hurdle to publishing a post straight after pushing it to GitHub was Gatsby. Github pages need an <code class=\"language-text\">index.html</code> file at the root and Gatsby builds the page into a subfolder(<code class=\"language-text\">public</code>).<br>\nSome solutions, push the build into a <code class=\"language-text\">gh-pages</code> branch, which is rather inconvenient because user pages must be built from the master branch.\nTaking this into account, my solution was the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Write posts or edit the page on the <code class=\"language-text\">develop</code> branch or other branches.</li>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https://github.com/daniel-vera-g/daniel-vera-g.github.io/blob/develop/.travis.yml\">Travis</a> to execute a <a href=\"https://github.com/daniel-vera-g/daniel-vera-g.github.io/blob/develop/scripts/deploy-to-gh-pages.sh\">script</a> after <code class=\"language-text\">pushing</code> changes to origin, which updates the master branch with the output of the <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby build</code> command.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"summary\"><a href=\"#summary\" aria-label=\"summary permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>To round up, Gatsby gives me a simple way to rapidly set up a great blog, which scales well in the future and looks nice.  As next steps, I will probably add a dark theme and some features like searching by tags or keywords.  Maybe in the future, I will consider changing to a plain HTML and CSS based site, as I find minimalistic sites like the one of <a href=\"https://patrickcollison.com/about\">Patrick Collison</a> or <a href=\"https://jrl.ninja/\">this one</a> pretty nice.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/new-blog/","tagSlugs":["/tag/personal/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-05-17","description":"A short description of this new blog.","tags":["personal"],"title":"New Blog"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/new-blog/"}}

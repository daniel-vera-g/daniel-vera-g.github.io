After going over some different versions of this page written with plain HTML, CSS(Using Bootstrap) and Javascript I decided to go for a static site generator. The main reasons were a more ease of use, maintainability and scalability.  
After researching a bit I went with [gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) over other great alternatives like Hugo or Jeykill. The reasons for this were clear:

1. Gatsby is written in Javascript, that means no new language like Go(Hugo) or Ruby(Jeykill)
2. Gastsby uses React and GraphQL, which are very interesting technologies I want to learn more about. So the advantage is two-fold.
3. You can use Markdown to write blog posts and customize the website, which is great.
4. The community is very helpful and there are a lot of great Themes to use.

I went with the [Gatsby starter Lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) theme, because of it's simplicity and active development.  

So to round up, Gatsby gives me a simple way to rapidly set up a great blog that scales well in the future and looks nicely.  As next steps, I will probably add a dark theme and some features like searching by tags or keywords.  Maybe in the future I will consider changing to a plain HTML and CSS based site, as I find minimalistic sites like the one of [Patrick Collison](https://patrickcollison.com/about) or [this one](https://jrl.ninja/) pretty nice.

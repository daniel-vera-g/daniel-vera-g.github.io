## Bitcoin

You found something useful on this blog and want to tip me, connect with my node or open a lightning channel?

> You need an [onion](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion) node to be able to connect to my bitcoin node and lightning node. If you still have a [clearnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearnet_(networking)) node, check out [this](https://stadicus.github.io/RaspiBolt/raspibolt_69_tor.html) awesome tutorial. Nevertheless, you can send me on chain or lightning tips having a clearnet node anyway.
